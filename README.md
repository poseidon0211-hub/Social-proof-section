## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- This project was an excellent way to practice creating a flexible and responsive layout. I focused on using Flexbox to manage the main containers and their children. The key to the desktop layout was using `flex-wrap` and negative margins/transformations to create the staggered card effect.


### Continued development

- I plan to continue practicing with CSS Flexbox and Grid, focusing on more complex nested layouts. 

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is my go-to guide for all things Flexbox.it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - An invaluable resource for checking CSS property definitions and browser compatibility.
